# Installation

TRDG does not currently possess and official Pypi package. The easiest way
to use the tool is by cloning the official repo.

`git clone https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator`

Then you need to install the dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual
environment for those.

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you want to use the handwritten text generation feature, you need to install
the `-hw` dependencies.

`pip3 install -r requirements-hw.txt`

Once that is done, you can move to the [tutorial](/tutorial.html) for tips and tricks
on how to use TRDG!
